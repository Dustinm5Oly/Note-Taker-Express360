<h1 align="center">Note-Taker-Express360</h1>  


## Description

* This application is to be able to allow a user to save notes with titles and then allow the user to delete the notes when completed.
* My motivation to create this app was to be able to understand how to use routing with a server file to link api calls to html files and display while using a created server.
* I designed this app to allow myself to better understand express and the use cases to set up a server environment that can be accessed through a localhost.
* The application allows the user to navigate to the local host and transfer to another "notes" page to be able to take and delete notes. 
* I was able to learn how to link json files to router files and display to the page through html files on a local host server.
